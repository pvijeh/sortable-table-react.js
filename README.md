## Task
Using React (JSX is optional), display the YouTube channels found in `js/main.js` in an HTML table. When a user clicks a table heading, the data should be sorted based on which column heading was clicked (e.g. clicking the "Views" heading should sort by views descending). Finally, add a search box and allow users to filter the result set as they type.

## Notes
Feel free to install any other JS/CSS libraries you'd like \*, but React is a requirement

## Bonus
Move the YouTube data into an external file, use AJAX & Promises to provide state for your React component.

\* Other than the JSX transformer, no transpilers are allowed (Coffee/TypeScript/etc)
